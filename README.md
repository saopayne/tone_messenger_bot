### What is this repository for? ###

The goal of this task is to create an emotional Facebook Messenger chat bot.
Depending on whether the user sends it a positive or negative message, it will gradually get happier or sadder, which will determine its responses.
All the responses are generic and simply visualise the mood of the bot.

The bot should also reply with its current mood for a special message "mood".
